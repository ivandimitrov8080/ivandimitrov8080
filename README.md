# Ivan Dimitrov
## Senior Web App Developer passionate about new technology

I do full stack development using a wide variety of technologies.

My work experience includes working with SAP Commerce (hybris) at RA Creative, where I successfully led projects from start to finish and mentored junior developers on their road to becoming the best programmer they can be.

SAP is a platform that makes building e-Commerce websites faster, easier and safer, thanks to the enormous amounts of predefined solutions already built in and the thought put into making a platform that is safe, portable and maintainable.
Other projects I've worked on mainly make use of Spring Boot or SvelteKit/NextJS.

I have used Linux both at work as well as a daily driver OS.
